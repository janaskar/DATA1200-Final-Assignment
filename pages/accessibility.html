                    Accessibility
                </h1>
                    <h2>
                        Template/Home/Index Page
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Correct use of head, nav, and footer helps navigation for users of
                            assistive devices. Good semantic and visual meaning and structure to the
                            document. Head contains site name and nav. Nav section has links to the
                            other pages. Footer has copyright date and socials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In html element we have use "en‚Äù, so the voice assistance know what
                            language to use. This helps voice assistant users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We use &lt;ul&gt; because the list does not require an order. Assistive
                            technologies and devices can navigate by and within lists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In head we have an input with two labels this will be confusing for those
                            that use screen readers, but since we could not use JavaScript, so we chose
                            to do it this way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In &lt;a&gt; element we don't have links without text which will make it
                            difficult for screen reader users. We can fix this by adding text about the
                            link and then hiding it so that it helps screen reader users. We just could
                            not find out how to hide the text properly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also have JavaScript device dependent event handler which can't be used
                            by keyboard users.
                        </p>
                    <h2>
                        Menu Page
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Alt text is useful for those who use screen readers, but our img don't have
                            that because this will just give the dish name again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Good use of headings this provide page navigation for users of assistive
                            technologies. They also facilitate semantic and visual meaning and good
                            structure in the document.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An &lt;object&gt; element is present this causes accessibility issues. We
                            should add HTML alternative so that voice assistant can read it.
                        </p>
                    <h2>
                        Locations Page
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Everything has good accessibly only problem is the locations nav, it has no
                            label and uses JavaScript to jump in the page.
                        </p>
                    <h2>
                        Booking Page
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            None of our input/select have labels screen reader users suffer.
                        </p>
                    <h2>
                        Topical Page
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Small text difficult for people with poor vision, it is only image text so
                            they can use zoom function if they really want to read the text.
                        </p>
                    <h2>
                        Choices

                        />
                        <p>
                            The use of rem and not em so that we can go into the root css and change it
                            if we wanted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We used lots of media queries so that we can support lots of screen sizes,
                            we may have used it too much. We also use % instead of px or pt so that the
                            page would be responsive. Less absolute units and more relative units.
                            Relative units are scalable units and helps in responsive design
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We test on virtual screens as small as Samsung fold to as big 1440p.
