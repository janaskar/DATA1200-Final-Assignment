                        ince the adoption of cloud computing, big data has been increasing exponentially in popularity,
                        both computer science and the wider world. This seemingly new paradigm of processing emerges on
                        the heels of e-Commerce and the explosion of Internet-enabled digital devices that allow
                        companies multiple channels and touch points to engage potential customers. The accepted
                        definition of big data is the digital analysis of datasets to extract insights, correlations and
                        causations, and value from data. Different groups have come up with different “Vs” to attempt to
                        formalize the definition of the big aspect of this phenomenon.
                        <br>The 3 Vs definition of big data, by Doug Laney for Gartner, states that if it has Volume,
                        Variety and Velocity then the data can be considered big <a
                            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128054673000144?via%3Dihub#br0195">[39]</a>.
                        Bernard Marr, in his book Big Data, adds Veracity (or validity) and Value to the original list
                        to create the 5 V's of big data <a
                            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128054673000144?via%3Dihub#br0250">[50]</a>.
                        With Volatility and Variability, Visibility, and Visualization added in some combination to the
                        list by different authors there is now a 7 Vs definition of what constitutes big data <a

                    <h3>Using sales and advertising as a basis the Vs based definition can be explained as: </h3>
                    <br><br>
                    •
                    Volume – With more data being collected, logged, and generated organizations need larger storage to
                    retain this information and larger compute to process it.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Velocity – Through online transactions and interactions the rate at which the Volume is being
                    created vastly exceeds data generated from person-to-person interactions. Online systems are also
                    expected to react in a timely manner meaning that the data needs to be processed as quickly as it
                    gets ingested.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Variety – A digital transaction gives more than just a sale, even a customer browsing certain
                    sections of an online store is valuable information, whether or not a sale is made. In an online
                    transaction, person A buying Object-X is not the only information that can be extracted.
                    Socio-economic, demographic, and consumer journey information can all be collected to improve future
                    sales and advertising. The problem becomes more complex within the inclusion of data from
                    traditional and social media.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Veracity – Large volumes of disparate data being ingested at high speed are only useful if the
                    information is correct. Incorrectly indexed data or spelling mistakes could make complete datasets
                    useless and thus the veracity is important.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Validity – Inferences derived from the data may also not always be accurate. As the saying goes
                    correlation does not always imply causation and so the validity of the insights derived from the
                    data need to be validated.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Value and Volatility – Value is a multifaceted property of big data. As the volume of data grows the
                    incremental value of each data point begins to decrease. As the variety of data available increases,
                    not all the data may aid in product development, sales, or system management. Data may also lose
                    relevance over time. In this case with the dataset not being a part of the business process how are
                    the costs of retention justified. Big data is not the retention of all data; some data needs to
                    remain volatile.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Value and Visibility – The key motivation behind big data is to extract value from the data. Many
                    would argue that this involves extracting hidden meaning from the available data. With valid and
                    valuable data information that is not visible may be extracted to make more informed business
                    decisions.
                    <br><br>

                    •
                    Variability – An extension of variety, variability exists where a metric of a dataset being
                    collected changes in an unpredictable manner that affects the entire business processes. Unexpected
                    purchasing behavior due to factors external to the supply chain means retailers and vendors would
                    need to dynamically tailor their pricing and advertising strategies accordingly.

                    <br><br>
                    •
                    Visualization – The adoption of big data within corporate business processes means the data needs to
                    be accessible to all who need it. Large dumps of statistical data may not always be easily
                    interpretable at a glance. Visualizing the data and any inferences is an additional important facet
                    of big data.
